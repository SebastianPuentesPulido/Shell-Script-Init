# Hello, Welcome in My First Archive For Shell Script
 This project has been created mostly using Github Copilot, in total thanks to the Github team for their help and allowing me to use their new tool, I have been testing this tool since yesterday and especially in shell script I see a significant performance in my productivity, it should be noted that this is not technical at all, it is just a step in my learning this language and by using this language I have been too surprised.

**most of the examples I took belong to this page =>** [ShellScript.sh](https://www.shellscript.sh/)
